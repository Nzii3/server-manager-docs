### It says I'm missing permissions, how?
Server Manager uses it's own custom permissions system that is easy to use and can be found when setting [!button size="xs" text="Configurations"](commands/configurations.md) and setting either the [!badge variant="info" text="Admin Roles"] or [!badge variant="info" text="Moderator Roles"] configurations.

!!!warning Warning
Server members with [!badge variant="info" text="Administrator"] permissions always bypass these custom permission checks. Members in at least one of the [!badge variant="info" text="Admin Roles"] bypass the [!badge variant="info" text="Moderator Roles"] check. Be mindful of what roles you set to bypass moderator checks.
!!!

If you have [!badge variant="info" text="Manage Guild"] permissions and still aren't able to use moderator/admin commands, you need to follow the [!badge variant="info" text="Admin Roles"] and [!badge variant="info" text="Moderator Roles"] checks. Ask Server Administrators to set those configurations so other staff members can use Server Manager to it's full potential.
