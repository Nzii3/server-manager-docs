Server Manager's suggestions system allows members to share their ideas about your server with ease, while allowing them to vote on other suggestions using buttons and vote percentages, similar to how a [poll's](./polls.md) voting works. **Server Manager allows the following of a suggestion** by clicking the `ðŸ””` button to subscribe to the suggestion, thus you getting direct messaged by the bot when a suggestion is **accepted**, **denied**, **considered**, **implemented**, **in progress**, or **commented on**. **Need to unsubscribe?** Just click the button again!
