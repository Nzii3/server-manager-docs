# Release v2.0.0

# :tada: Server Manager v2.0.0! 
It has been a long road from the rewrite. So many things have been rewritten, added, and modified. But all notable changes will be made known further down in this message.

## Premium
Premium has changed in a few ways. 
### Purchasing Destination
Instead of purchasing using our Ko-fi page, premium and custom branding options are available on my client portal (https://client.nziie.xyz), specifically at https://r.nziie.xyz/server-manager-store 
### Pricing Changes
Yup! Pricing has went down for normal premium, down to 1€/month instead of 3€/month. 
### Custom Branding Removal
At this time, custom branding has been removed. Custom branded bots will only be given to server affiliates upon request and approval. [Learn more.](https://servermanagerbot.ml/support)
### Redeeming
We are now using slots as our form of redeeming premium. When you subscribe for 1€/month, within 12 hours, you will be direct messaged saying a premium slot has been added to your premium profile. Then, you can use the </premium:1> command — where you can manage beta access, premium server, and custom branded bot slots — and activate the premium server slot. The duration of the product ("slot") will be 1 month, so it matches your subscription duration.

When renewing, you will be sent another premium slot, if you do not renew the subscription, the premium from the server will be removed and you will lose all benefits. However, you are given a 1 day grace period to make the payment. If you do renew your subscription and don’t receive the slot (after 12 hours has past), feel free to reach out to us using our support system (@Helper).
