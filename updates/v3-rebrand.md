# v3 Update Plan (Rebrand)

Greetings, everyone! I appreciate your understanding as I share some crucial updates for this support server. I've made the decision to **rebrand** Server Manager for its upcoming v3 version. Collaborating with a longstanding development team, the new bot, **[Sentry](<https://sentry.nziie.xyz>)**, is in the works, maintaining the naming convention from its predecessor, BumpYourServer.

Sentry will primarily function as an advanced moderation bot, with the integration of enhanced and reimagined features from Server Manager. Notably, functionalities like Giveaways, Forms, Suggestions, Polls, and Templates will be temporarily paused until the release of either v1.5 or v2, both of which are major updates.

## Transition to Sentry
The release of Sentry is slated for mid-January 2024, the goal being January 7th.

## Data Migration
Regrettably, server data, encompassing cases, giveaways, templates, suggestions, form data, and more, will not be automatically transferred. Servers currently using Server Manager will experience a data reset upon joining Sentry, initiating a fresh start.

> If you wish to obtain your server's data from Server Manager's database, please direct message me before ~January 10th. Include your server's ID for verification. Please note that data retrieval is limited to server owners for privacy reasons, and co-owners or administrators are excluded.

## What's Next?
Feel free to continue utilizing Server Manager as usual. The subsequent announcement will detail a 24-hour grace period, allowing everyone to manage their affairs with Server Manager before its complete transformation into Sentry. This support server will be deprecated and deleted 1 month after the official release (v1) of Sentry.

Server Manager has been an extraordinary project, and the positive feedback received through direct messages has been heartening. I'm excited about Sentry, a continuation of Server Manager's legacy, crafted by an exceptional development team and backed by 2 amazing communities, Server Manager's and BumpYourServer's.
