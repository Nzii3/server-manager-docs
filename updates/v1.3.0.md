# Release v1.3.0

### TL;DR
  - [Approved for Message Content Intent](#message-content-intent-approval)
  - [NEW Log Command](#new-log-command)

## Message Content Intent Approval
As of today (4/26/2023), we now have
the **Message Content Intent**. This is not given to bots that don't apply for it after verification. This intent is pretty hard to get since your use case has to be pretty unique and useful, and the new log command fullfills that criteria. This intent gives us more flexibility and freedom when making features and commands that makes us rely on a message object. Thus, allowing us to make features we couldn't add before.

## New Log Command
A command, `/log` has been added where you can save a channel's last 100 max (200 max for premium) messages and have a [realistic log, powered by `logs.discord.website`](https://logs.discord.website).
