Discord has forced us to shut down BumpYourServer without a real chance to appeal any actions they have suspected of us omitting.","Queue the sad music:musical_note:"]},{"l":"What Happened","p":["On 10/25/2023 — about 5 days ago as of writing this — Discord disabled BYS. After investigating and contacting Discord support, we were made aware that BYS was not complying with Discord's Terms of Service and/or Developer Policy. After waiting for a response back from Discord they stated we may be breaking this rule:","Do not attempt to manipulate engagement. You may not participate, enable, or promote the inflating of server membership with bot or user accounts of mass creation of user accounts to redeem rewards or send messages. You may not automate messages to be sent of the purpose of maintaining message activity in a Discord community.","You may be asking, why would a bump bot create accounts for activity in a server? Great question, we don't know either, but we do know that BYS doesn't do this in any way. We have not made any breaking changes to BYS to manipulate engagement, create user/bot accounts to redeem rewards or send messages, automate messages to increase user message activity in a Discord community, and we have neither added any type of rewards anyone can redeem.","Discord didn't make it clear what we added/changed was to make us not comply with Discord's terms and agreement. The only — I guess you can consider \"breaking\" — thing that was changed was the queue behavior, which does none of these. We modified the queue to make it go faster but not get close to being rate limited, and to lower queue times. I (Nziie) have reviewed the terms and guidelines for bots many times to know that BYS isn't doing anything different than any other bump bots you are probably using. BYS probably follows more rules than your other favorite bump bots, when it comes to rewards, paid bumping, and rate limits.","At this time, Discord has closed our ticket not giving us another chance to appeal. However, we're still going to try and get this cleared up since we haven't done anything wrong. By God's name, you know we're going to try everything to get this beloved bot and project back and running — but it doesn't seem likely."]},{"i":"what-next","l":"What Next?","p":["At this time, we are browsing and discussing the idea of making a highly customizable Moderation bot, to be known as HelpYourServer. Our goal with this is to help servers that are looking for a very customizable-straight-foward moderation bot with no major feature locking paywalls. This will be a long project that will take us into 2024. Around Christmas time, we will put out another update regarding the route we will be taking. Don't worry, you'll stay updated and informed \uD83D\uDE09.","It has been an incredible road that was BumpYourServer. Seeing people complimenting BYS on how it grew their server made me smile, knowing that I made a difference in someone's life. For me, that's why I still do this hobby; I love helping people.
